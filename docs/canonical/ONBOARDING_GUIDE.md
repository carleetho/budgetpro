# BudgetPro Developer Onboarding Guide

> **Goal**: Fully productive in 1 week (vs. 4 weeks).

## 1. Welcome

Welcome to the BudgetPro team. You are joining a project built on **Hexagonal Architecture** and **Domain-Driven Design**. Our documentation strategy is unique: we use **Canonical Notebooks** as the Single Source of Truth.

## 2. The Strategy

Instead of reading 100 random wiki pages, you will:

1. **Read** the Canonical Notebooks in a specific order.
2. **Query** our AI Knowledge Engine (NotebookLM) to clarify concepts.
3. **Verify** your understanding with Checkpoints.
4. **Implement** your first task using the Notebooks as a spec.

## 3. Your First Week Schedule

| Day       | Focus            | Goal                                           |
| --------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Day 1** | System Overview  | Understand Architecture & Data Model           |
| **Day 2** | Module Deep Dive | Master one specific domain (e.g., Presupuesto) |
| **Day 3** | Integration      | Understand how modules talk (API/Events)       |
| **Day 4** | Tooling Setup    | Configure Cursor & NotebookLM                  |
| **Day 5** | Hands-On         | Merge your first PR                            |
